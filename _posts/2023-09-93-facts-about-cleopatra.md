I love learning about misconceptions, and there are many surrounding Cleopatra,
the ruler of Egypt from 51 BCE to 30 BCE.

## 1. She wasn't Egyptian

Yup. She was actually Macedonian Greek, a member of the
[Ptolemaic dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_dynasty). This
dynasty ruled the [Ptolemaic Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom)
in Ancient Egypt from 305 BCE to 30 BCE (if you're concentrating, you'll have
noticed that our queen in question was the last ruler of the dynasty).

## 2. She (probably) wasn't all that beautiful

Cleopatra is often famed for her beauty, but she probably wasn't all that beautiful.
As mentioned, she came from a long line of incest (her parents may have been
siblings). The myth of her being a beautiful seductress was propaganda spread by
Octavian, an opponent of Cleopatra's lover, Marcus Antonius.
Octavian wanted to paint the picture that Mark Anthony had been seduced by an
exotic seductress and could therefore not be trusted by the Roman people.

## 3. She (probably) did not eat pearls in vinegar

## 4. She (probably) did not die by letting a snake bite her breast

The notion that she committed suicide by putting an asp (snake) to her breast is a myth. She likely poisoned herself. The poison however, probably did come from a snake.
