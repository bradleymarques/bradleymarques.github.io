I love learning about misconceptions: debunking them not only clarifies the truth but also provides some insights into the societal and cultural contexts that propagated the misinformation. Recognizing these errors illuminates not just the fact at hand, but also the deeper narratives and beliefs of the society that fostered such misconceptions. There are many misconceptions surrounding Cleopatra VII Thea Philopator, the last pharaoh of Ancient Egypt. Here are some I find quite interesting:

### 1. She was not Egyptian

Despite ruling over Egypt and being associated predominantly with Egyptian culture, Cleopatra wasn't ethnically Egyptian. Hailing from the Macedonian Greek lineage, she belonged to the [Ptolemaic dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemaic_dynasty). The history is long and nuanced, but the TL;DR is that [Alexander the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great) conquered Egypt in 332 BCE, taking it from the Persians. After Alexander's death, his general, [Ptolemy I Soter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptolemy_I_Soter), declared himself Pharaoh of Egypt, and thus began a nearly three century rule by the Ptolemaic dynasty. Cleopatra was the last of the Ptolemaic rulers.

Despite not being Egyptian, she distinguished herself from her predecessors by embracing Egyptian customs and being the first Ptolemaic ruler to speak the Egyptian language, strengthening her bond with her subjects.

### 2. She was the result of incest

To keep their bloodline pure and maintain political control, members of the Ptolemaic dynasty often married within their family. Cleopatra's own lineage is testament to this â€” she married two of her brothers (whom she outlived) and is believed to be the product of an incestuous relationship, though this has not been definitively proven.

### 3. She probably wasn't all that beautiful

While movies and literature often portray Cleopatra as a breathtaking beauty, historical records suggest that her charm might have been more about intelligence, wit, and charisma rather than physical beauty. The portrayal of Cleopatra as a seductive beauty might have been a narrative crafted by her political enemies, particularly [Octavian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus).

### 4. She probably didn't eat pearls in vinegar

There is a famous story of Cleopatra dissolving a pearl in vinegar and drinking it to win a bet against Mark Antony about who could have the most lavish and expensive meals. This story may be more of an allegory (probably spread by [Pliny the Elder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder)) about her extravagant wealth and the lengths to which she'd go to prove a point than a historical fact.

> "There have been two pearls that were the largest in the whole of history; both were owned by Cleopatra, the last of the Queens of Egypt - they had come down to her through the hands of the Kings of the East ... In accordance with previous instructions the servants placed in front of her only a single vessel containing vinegar, the strong rough quality of which can melt pearls. She was at the moment wearing in her ears that remarkable and truly unique work of nature. Antony was full of curiosity to see what in the world she was going to do. She took one earring off and dropped the pearl in the vinegar, and when it was melted swallowed it... With this goes the story that, when that queen who had won on this important issue was captured, the second of this pair of pearls was cut in two pieces, so that half a helping of the jewel might be in each of the ears of Venus in the Pantheon at Rome."

-- Pliny, Natural History (IX.59.119-121; also Macrobius, Saturnalia, III.17.14-17)

### 5. She was much more than a lover

Beyond her romantic associations with powerful figures like Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, Cleopatra was a savvy political operator. Her alliances were strategic, aiming to bolster Egypt's position on the global stage and resist Roman imperialism.

### 6. Her suicide

While tales of Cleopatra's suicide by snake bite have captured the popular imagination, thanks in part to dramatisations by the likes of William Shakespeare, the truth might be more subdued. Historical evidence suggests a likely poisoning by swallowing of snake venom, although the exact circumstances remain a topic of debate.

She's still very cool, though.
