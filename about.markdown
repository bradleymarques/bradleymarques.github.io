I'm Brad, a software engineer who loves building things.

I've mainly focussed on full-stack web development in Ruby on Rails and Python,
but I also like building games in things like Unity3D and Godot.

I also like history. I happen to be a self-taught expert in the history of China
during the Sui Dynasty (581 - 618), and have written a book set in that time. I
am also really interested in the Norman conquest of Southern Italy (999 - 1139),
and hope to write about that someday too.

Here's some things I find interesting. Maybe you will too?
